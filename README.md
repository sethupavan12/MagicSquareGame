# MagicSquareGame
A Magic Square game that could generate Magic Sqaures of size n*n when give n as an input. The game can also give player a randomly generated sqaure so that the player can make use of his extremely powerful computational organ(Brain) to convert the given sqaure into a Magic Sqaure.


# What is a Magic Sqaure?
Magic Squares are square grids with a special arrangement of numbers in them. These numbers are special because every row, column and diagonal adds up to the same number.

# Why is it called "Magic" Sqaure though?

(Friendly History Alert)
So the numbers in the Magic Square are special, but why are they called magic? It seems that from ancient times they were connected with the supernatural and magical world. The earliest record of magic squares is from China in about 2200 BC. and is called "Lo-Shu". There's a legend that says that the Emperor Yu saw this magic square on the back of a divine tortoise in the Yellow River.

The black knots show even numbers and the white knots show odd numbers. Look closely and you'll see that this ancient magic square is the same as our example above. Magic squares were first mentioned in the Western world in the work of Theon of Smyrna. They were also used by Arab astrologers in the 9th century to help work out horoscopes. The work of the Greek mathematician Moschopoulos in 1300 A.D. help to spread knowledge about magic squares. So here we are now, more than 700 years later, and teachers are using them in class for problem solving and practising addition.
